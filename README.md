# portfolio-website

This is my practice in building a portfolio website to showcase my skills in creating single page applications and responsive web design.

##  Introduction

My portfolio website features various sections, including an "About" where visitors can download my CV, as well as sections for showcasing my skills, portfolios and blogs and contact. 
For this project, I utilized Vite, React and SCSS. In React, I utilized hooks such as useState, useRef and useEffect. To enable visitors to send messages through an online form directly to my email, I integrated the emailJs npm tool into the contact section.
